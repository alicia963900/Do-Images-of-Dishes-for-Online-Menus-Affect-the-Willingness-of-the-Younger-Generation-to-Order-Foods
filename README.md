# Do-Images-of-Dishes-for-Online-Menus-Affect-the-Willingness-of-the-Younger-Generation-to-Order-Foods

## **Problem**
Does adding images of dishes in the online ordering menu affect the willingness of the younger generation to order foods?

## **Goal**
Our goal is to help restaurants increase their online ordering revenue by designing a menu with images of each dish. 

## **Experiment process**
Create two versions of the menu. One with the images (as treatment), and the other one without images(as control);      
Create a survey through google form; 
Evenly assign the participants to two versions of the menu to observe their intentions of ordering;
Collect the survey outcome and analyze the data.

## **Randomization**
In terms of randomization, we intend to design our treatment with the blocking method.​ To be more specific, the treatment group and control group will have the same characteristics(same numbers of male and female; same numbers of people from each location…)
